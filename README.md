# Improved IPC

Improved Electron IPC api
 - Fully typed ipcMain and Renderer
 - Exception pass-through

Based on [electron-typed-ipc](https://github.com/deiucanta/electron-typed-ipc) by Andrei Canta.
Use theirs package if you just need typescript enhancements (without exceptions)

## Usage

## TODO

 - Return types
 - Exceptions
 - webContents sendToFrame, postMessage
 - Types for webContents instead of ipcMain (?)
 - Test
